        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The Gauss Method, also known as Gaussian elimination, is an efficient way to calculate the determinant of a matrix. The method involves transforming the matrix into an upper triangular matrix (or row echelon form) using row operations, where the determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of the diagonal elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps for the Gauss Method:\n",
        "1. **Transform the Matrix into Upper Triangular Form**: Use elementary row operations to eliminate the entries below the diagonal (i.e., make the elements below the main diagonal zero).\n",
        "2. **Calculate the Determinant**: Once the matrix is in triangular form, the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements. If row swaps were used during elimination, the sign of the determinant may change.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Elementary Row Operations:\n",
        "- **Row swapping**: If two rows are swapped, the determinant changes its sign.\n",
        "- **Row scaling**: Multiplying a row by a constant scales the determinant by that constant.\n",
        "- **Row addition**: Adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the determinant.\n",
