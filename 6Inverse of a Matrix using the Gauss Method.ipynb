It involves performing row operations on the augmented matrix $[A | I]$, where $A$ is the original matrix and $I$ is the identity matrix, until the left part of the augmented matrix becomes the identity matrix. If the left part can be transformed into the identity matrix, the right part of the augmented matrix will be the inverse of $A$.\n",
